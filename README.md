# Bookstore-AWS

**Bookstore-AWS** is a cloud deployment project on AWS demonstrating three scalable architectures for a bookstore platform:

- **Objective 1:** Single monolithic instance with local storage.  
- **Objective 2:** Monolithic application with external AWS storage (Aurora RDS, EFS), plus Load Balancer and Auto-Scaling.  
- **Objective 3:** Distributed microservices (Authentication, Book, Order) managed with Docker Swarm.
